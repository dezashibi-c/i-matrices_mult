# Matrices Multiplier in C

reads matrices data from the given file and prints the result of multiplying them after checking the multiplication possibility

## Implementation

I would like to have a file called `input_mat.txt` with the format like this:

```plain
2 3
1 2 9
4 5 6
3 2
7 8
9 10
11 12

```

**NOTE:** you don't need to put each data in a separate line, that's just for formatting, **be aware of the trailing spaces**.

First line is the size of the first matrix, then the data for the first one, then comes the second matrix size and its data. simple.

I would also check the data validity and then possibility of multiplying two matrices together and finally will print the result.

## Project structure

It's a one file project, and yes it's not a bad thing necessarily to do this especially with dealing with these kind of calculation or handy tools, if you know what I mean, so just use your own compiler like `gcc`, `clang`, `zig cc` or any other and compile then run, that's it.

To test it more change the `input_mat.txt` content based on the description.
